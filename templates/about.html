  <ul  style="font-size:8px, text-font: Georgia, serif, margin-left:20px">
    <li><strong>Long-Term Goal:</strong> On the journey of acquiring a new habit, it is impotant to think about the longer term goal. This goal reflects what type of person one might be striving to be and it is a strong accountability aspect.</li>
    <li><strong>Goal Tree:</strong> Goal tree is the main feature of the application: it helps to draw a connection between small daily actions and our long-term purpose. With the purpose in mind, we are intrinsically motivated to do everyday actions to be the person we want to be.</li>
    <li><strong>Tracker:</strong>In order to know where we stand in our journey and give us the credit we deserve, the tracker informs about every single daily action, when we finish doing it. This is an essential behavior control element. </li>
